To get everything set up, we have a environment.yml that already contains all the pacakages that are required,. Please run this in python version 3.12 or later:

First download the entire repository down and navigate to the root directory (CS-7641 ML/A3) via terminal

Ensure conda is installed, and then run:
conda env create -f environment.yml

- This will recreate a virtual environment called test.
- When it is installed you can then activate the environment using conda activate test
- Run the code as necessary -> rice.py will run all charts needed for rice dataset, mushroom.py will run all charts needed for mushroom dataset, and correlation.py will run all charts needed for correlation charts.
